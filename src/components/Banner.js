                        <p>A software engineer whose mission is to make working life simpler, 
                            more pleasant, and more productive. I have been working professionally 
                            as a developer since 2012 and hold a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science from 
                            Eritrea Institute of Technology.
                            Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family and friends(stating the obvious),
                            drawing on procreate, cooking, sightseeing and learing new languages - Arabic and French.</p>
